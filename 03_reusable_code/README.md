# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

Deliverable 3: Reusable `R` code wrapped in an `R` package or `Shiny` app.

 I made a `Shiny app`, which can be found on the shiny server at [https://wardeiling.shinyapps.io/GLMM_population-averaged-and-person-specific-interpretations/](https://wardeiling.shinyapps.io/GLMM_population-averaged-and-person-specific-interpretations/) and the development repository can be found at the development repository [https://github.com/wardeiling/Rshiny_GLMM_interpretations](https://github.com/wardeiling/Rshiny_GLMM_interpretations).
 
 link the app on a `Shiny` server and your development repository (on GitHub).
